# BitChess
Chess in Deno using Attack sets and Bitwise logic

- Represents board with attack and piece sets, allowing for faster move generation
- Usage of bitwise logic where possible

TODO:
- Explore refactoring some objects, like RayDirections, as nested arrays instead of objects to prevent number to string conversion when accessing properties. May be faster.
